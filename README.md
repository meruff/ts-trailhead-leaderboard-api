# ts-trailhead-leaderboard-api

A quick set of [Supabase Edge Functions](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions) thrown together to extend my [go-trailhead-leaderboard-api](https://github.com/meruff/go-trailhead-leaderboard-api). Assists with interfacing with Trailhead's graphql queries easier than Golang can.
